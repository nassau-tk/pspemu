Minifire (c) TyRaNiD 2k6

You know you're bored when...

Here is a mini fire demo for the PSP, size (minus EBOOT header) is 671 bytes, it could be smaller
but I couldn't be bothered. This is to show that pure asm coding isn't totally dead and size 
coding is where the real action is.

Provided with source, as I use straight syscalls then you need to build it different for v1 and
v1.5, just type make BUILD_V1=1 for v1 version. Of course the executable you end up with is 
slightly larger than my mini version even though it is the same code. I'll leave that as an 
excercise for the reader on how to make it smaller ;) If I had a better binary assembler I would
have put it out in one package.

Oh and while it is running hit any button to exit back to the VSH.

Props to the usual group, you know who you are.

Let the size coding begin.
